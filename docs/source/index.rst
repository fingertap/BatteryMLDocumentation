Welcome to BatteryML's documentation!
=====================================

**BatteryML** is a Python library for general battery degradation modeling. It incorporates out-of-the-box machine learning algorithms and reorganizes existing public datasets for battery degradation modeling. It supports major tasks such as early battery lifespan estimation, state of health estimation, and state of charge estimation. It is designed with extensibility in mind, easily adapted to various data input formats and different downstream tasks.
